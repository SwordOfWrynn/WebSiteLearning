        <p><i>A well fortified house, the Safe House serves as a backup center of operations for towns under siege..</i>
        </p>
        <p>The Safe House is a special type of Garrison House that also serves as a forward base for players to spawn
            at. Safe Houses are critical part of a towns defenses, either providing a significant obstacle to the enemy
            forces trying to reach the Town Hall, or providing a base to launch counter strikes from if the Town Hall
            falls. The Safe House provides AI in a medium radius, and allows the controlling faction to rebuild nearby
            Garrison Houses, even if they have lost control of the Town Hall. A fully upgraded Safe House with Artillery
            Shelter can be very hard to kill if properly supplied and defended, as (for the most part) it can only be
            killed from the inside. The Safe House has far more health than other Garrison Houses, and has 3 Tiers, each
            having more health, with Tier 3 being able to shoot Anti-Tank Rifles at enemy vehicles.</p>
