    <h1>Relic Tanks</h1>
    <p>A rare sight, relic tanks are the result of long lost technology, and often outperform their seemingly more
      modern counterparts.</p>

    <h3>Storm Tank</h3>
    <div class="subtype">
      <p><i>A light armoured mechanized vehicle first seen in early border skirmishes between Caoiva and Veli. With its
          thin frame,
          it was deployed in wide formations, often overwhelming enemy forces. The Storm Tank has superiour alloy armor
          and a more rapid
          fire 40mm gun than its current day counterparts.</i></p>

    <h3>PL-1 "Phalanx"</h3>
    <div class="subtype">
      <p><i>Ancient by modern standards, this first iteration heavily armoured Colonial Assault tank is fitted with full
          coverage shielding and equipped with twin sponson cannons.</i></p>
