        <h1>Garrisoned House</h1>
        <p><i>Once a humble home or shop, this building has been been fortified and turned into a protected firing
                position for the vigilant soldiers inside.</i></p>
        <p>Garrison Houses are common defensive AI structures inside of towns. They have several windows that have been
            turned into firing ports that the AI or players can shoot out of. All but the smallest type of Garrison
            house has a blind side with now firing ports. Garrison Houses come in three sizes, with bigger Garrison
            Houses having more health. In addition, there are three tiers of Garrison House, with each tier also having
            more health then the previous one. Tier 3 Garrison Houses can also shoot Anti-Tank Rifles at enemy vehicles.
            You can determine what Tier a Garrison House is by looking at the firing ports, Tier 1 is covered by cloth,
            Tier 2 by wood, and Tier 3 firing ports are metal.</p>
