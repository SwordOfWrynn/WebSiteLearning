        <h1>Town Halls</h1>
        <p><i>The political center of a town or region, Town Halls are a symbolic and strategic target.</i></p>
        <p>The Town Hall is the most important structure in a town, as it allows players to spawn, provides a stockpile
            for equipment, garrisons AI structures in a large radius, and control of the Town Hall is required to build
            the other structures of the town. There are three tiers of Town Hall.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Garrison Camp</h3>
        <div class="subtype">
            <p><i>The temporary base of a new administration, the Garrison Camp is little more than a tent giving the
                    occupiers a place to oversee the town or city.</i></p>
            <p>The Garrison Camp is the first tier of Town Hall, and has the least amount of health, and costs the most
                to build. Like all Tier 1 structures, it can be damaged by heavy weapons.</p>

        <h3>Garrison Base</h3>
        <div class="subtype">
            <p><i>The base of an established administration, the Garrison Base allows its owners to further control the
                    town it oversees.</i></p>
            <p>The Garrison Base is the second tier of Town Hall, and allows the construction of Tier 2 buildings in the town.</p>

        <h3>Town Hall</h3>
        <div class="subtype">
            <p><i>The base of a well entrenched administration, the Town Hall signifies the complete control of the town.</i></p>
            <p>The Town Hall is the final tier, and has the most health. It allows the construction of Tier 3 buildings in the town.</p>
