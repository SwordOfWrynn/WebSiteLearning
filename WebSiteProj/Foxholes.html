        <p><i>The Foxhole is a basic defense struture, allowing one soldier to take cover within it.</i></p>
        <p>The Foxhole is the cheapest AI structure in the game, manned by a single AI soldier with a rifle. Being the
            cheapest and fastest defense to build, foxholes are used to secure a variety of areas and supply routes. A
            single player character may also take cover in the foxhole</p>
